# Earthworm-Deer-Multiyear
Manuscript accepted Journal of Ecology January 2024

Variable	Description
site	Bobolink Hill (BOB), Connecticut Hill Game Management Area (CON), Hammond Hill State Forest (HAM), Ringwood Preserve (RIN), and Yellow Barn State Forest (YEL)
Row	Planting row 1-20 within each plot (no more than oneindividual of each species per row)
Year	Experimental year (planted spring, fall 2012 and spring 2013)
Year.order	Years in order 1-5
worms	Worm presence/absence
deer	Deer presence/absence
Drybiomass.mean	Dry earthworm biomass (g) from ten 50 x 50cm plots sampled with hot mustard pour
I.Species	Initial species specific measurements used in models, in cm. We measured height to the highest non-reproductive node in most species and the highest point of a leaf for graminoids and fern fronds. We counted non-reproductive culms of Carex and measured width as maximum distance across the widest point of the entire plant for Caulophyllum, Actaea, and Adiantum. For other species where width measurements across the entire plant were difficult, we measured width of the largest leaf. 
Species.S	Species observed/not observed. Does not account for dormant individuals who appeared later
Species.final	We retroactively scored dormant individuals as alive if they re-appeared in later years
Species.H	Height in cm (see I.Species)
Species.W	Width in cm (see I.Species)
Species.NS	Number of stems
Species.i	Presence/absence of insect attack
Species.B	Other browse (s=slug, b=broken, i=insect, d=deer, r=rodent)
Species.NL	Number or leaves
Species.NFr	Number of fronds from the current year
Species.F	Presence/Absence of flowering
Species.NF	Number of flowers
Species.FH	Flowering height
Carex.NC	Number of culms
Geum.propagules	Number or propagules appearing away from original planting site
Tiarella.NT	Number of tillers moving out in a cardinal direction from original planting site
Tiarella.TL	Tiller length, where individual tillers were visible
Tiarella.Sarea	A measurement we started including only once individual tillers were no longer visible and instead a mat of asexual/sexual growth spread out from original planting location. In m^-2
Species.mattype	Qualitative description of mat-type vegetation growing in a 1x1m around the planting site
Species.native	% cover of native vegetation growing in a 1x1m around the planting site
Species.nonnative	% cover of non nativevegetation growing in a 1x1m around the planting site
Species.mattype	% cover of mat-like vegetation growing in a 1x1m around the planting site
Species.bare	% cover of bare ground in a 1x1m around the planting site
Species.SPAD	Mean of three SPAD meter readings done on leaves to approximate chlorophyl content in 2015
Species.ID	Individual plant ID (unique number 1-8000)
